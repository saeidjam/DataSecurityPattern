# Data Security Pattern Project

This repository contains the source code for applications demonstrating various data security patterns. It is intended to accompany the paper submission on data security practices and patterns.

## Overview

The Data Security Pattern project aims to provide clear examples and practical implementations of security patterns that protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

## Contents

- Source code for each data security pattern discussed in the paper.
- Detailed comments explaining the code and how it implements the security patterns.
- Documentation on the design decisions and trade-offs for each pattern.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through exploring the source code and understanding the security patterns implemented.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following:
- A suitable development environment for the programming language used (e.g., Python, Java, C#).
- Any specific frameworks or libraries mentioned in the paper.

### Installation
